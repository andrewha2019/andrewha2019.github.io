## C&A Vending Machine
by Kyungchul Ha and Christopher Mack II

### Introduction:

For our 4180 project, we decided to create a vending machine. The vending machine has the ability to check for payment
Once the payment is checked, there are two buttons to choose two snack options.
When selecting a button, the vending machine dispenses the correct snack.
If one were to run out of money, the vending machine also has money refilling station.
